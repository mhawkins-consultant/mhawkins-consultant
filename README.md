- 👋 Hi, I’m @mhawkins-consultant
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, LINUX, networking and cybersecurity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the time.
- 💞️ I have developed an STM32 based drop in replacement for the 80C85 CPU for the Korg Poly-800. Software is currently (2024) under development. See https://www.hawk800.com. I am also working on various other projects including, Internet traffic simulators, firewall policy management tools and consumer grade, web controlled, speaker switch (https://www.katoombasound.com) and audio level controllers. Also, network device configuration tools and configuration analysis tools. Lots of Fortinet FortiManager TCL,CLI, and JINJA scripts. Lot's of bash, php, perl network device management scripts. Oh, and I also maintain my own home media/control server which streams audio to pi's all over the house and acts as a super alarm clock, personal journal, golf tracker, and more...
