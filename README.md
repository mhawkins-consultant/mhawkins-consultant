- 👋 Hi, I’m @mhawkins-consultant
- 👀 In technology, I’m mainly interested in networking, cybersecurity, microcontrollers, coding, and LINUX.
- In other pursuits, I am interested in astronomy, astrophotography, electronic music synthesis, and golf.
- 🌱 I’m currently - learning all the time.
- 💞️ I have developed an STM32 (STM32F373CC) drop in replacement for the 80C85 CPU for the Korg Poly-800 music synthesizer. Software for the synth is currently (2024) under development. See https://www.hawk800.com. I am also working on various other projects including, Internet traffic simulators, firewall policy management tools and consumer grade, web controlled, speaker switch (https://www.katoombasound.com) and audio level controllers. Also, network device configuration tools and configuration analysis tools. Lots of Fortinet FortiManager TCL,CLI, and JINJA scripts. Lot's of bash, php, perl network device management scripts. Oh, and I also maintain my own home media/control server which streams audio to pi's all over the house and acts as a super home control system, alarm clock, personal journal, golf tracker, and more...
- Finally, I do my best to try to help maintain Armbian support for the BananaPi M2 Zero. See https://www.armbian.com/bananapi-m2-zero/
